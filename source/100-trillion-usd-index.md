Today we launched a new indicator index: **100TUI**

100TUI is a index designed by Twitter user @100trillionusd [шо╛шоб](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1091654077182820352) and implemented by the GBI team.

The 100TUI index's data is based on the price of Bitcoin vs US Dollars, the number of days from the nearest BTC block reward halving date.

We render the index with colors. The change in the gradient color shows the relationship between the half-day of the block reward and the Bitcoin price.

The 100TUI index indicates that **the farther away from the block reward, the stronger the redshift; the closer the distance is to half the day, the stronger the blue shift**.

In the index chart, we can see the impact of the change in the Bitcoin supply on the Bitcoin market price.
