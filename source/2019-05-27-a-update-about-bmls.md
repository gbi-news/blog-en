This update includes one major feature:

## Additional BMLS components

为了更好地呈现多空两方的力量，我们在 BMLS 上新增了两条曲线，分别表示多方和空方的总额绝对值。

In order to represent the power of long margin and short margin in a better way, we added two new curves on the BMLS chart, which represent the absolute total value of long margin and short margin.

In which,

the green curve is the total amount of the long margin, and the red curve is the total amount of the short margin. 

Combined with the BMLS master curve (the blue one), it can be used to observe how the long and short powers in the bitcoin market are changing.
