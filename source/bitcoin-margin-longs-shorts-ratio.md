Today we launched a new index: **Bitcoin Margin Long-Short ratio (BMLS)**

BMLS is designed by [Longmen Fund](http://www.longmen.fund/) and implemented by GBI team.

The index could be calculated as follow:

```latex,autorun
BMLS = 
  \frac{ Bitfinex\ Bitcoin Long Margin}{ Bitfinex\ Bitcoin Short Margin} 
  \times 100
```

The index is affected by requirement of Bitcoin long and short orders. It can be used as a market sentiment indicator. When the indicator is below 100%, it means bearish sentiment, and vice versa.
